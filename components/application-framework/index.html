<p>
    In order to facilitate the user experience, we have created a generic app layout that helps make the app consistent and usable.

<h3>Anatomy</h3>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <img class="w-100" src="components/application-framework/images/anatomy.svg">
</div>
<div><b>1. Header name:</b> For Werfen product name. This should always and only link the user to the domainâ€™s home page. In many cases the baseline is used to give context to the user about de product (eg: laboratory name)</div>
<div><b>2. Utilities (optional):</b>
    The header provides a home for global system-level utilities from anywhere in the site. Utility icons should not be used to directly navigate to an area. Instead, they should open a panel that provides access to other places in the product.
    </div>
<div><b>3. Logged user:</b> Provide information about the logged user.</div>
<div><b>4. Main menu (optional):</b> The main menu icon is used to open product navigation, in a big applications you could use a second navigation bottom aligned.</div>
<hint>The main menu icon used must identify the application module it represents</hint>
