<h2 id="errors-and-validation">Errors and validation</h2>
    <h3>Client-side errors</h3>
    <p>
        Validate as much of the user's data before submission as possible. This real-time validation should happen when the input field loses focus and checks for input errors like invalid characters and empty fields. This helps users easily identify mistakes and fix them before submitting the login form.

<h3>Server-side errors</h3>
<p>
    If there are server-side errors when the user submits the login form, the page should be reloaded, the password field cleared, and the user returned to the username input field. Use an inline notification to display the errors and provide clear direction on how users should resolve the issue.
