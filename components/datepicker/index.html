<ul>
  <li>
    Date picker is a calendar-view popover. It is paired with a text input so that it can send a formatted date value to the input.
  </li>
  <li>
    Date picker is shown by clicking, or gaining focus on the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Today’s date is selected with border blue. Unless preloaded with another date, today’s date will be selected in the Date Picker.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicking on the check-calendar icon inside the Date Picker returns the focus to today’s date.
  </li>

</ul>


<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>
  A Date picker is used to select a date when a user needs to understand the date in context with other possible dates. Date choices are influenced by day of the week, or week within a month.
</p>
<p>
  Date pickers aren’t helpful when the date is a known value like a birthdate. A user will likely want to type that value in versus hunting for it in a Date Picker. In cases where space is limited, it may be a good idea to omit the Date Picker.
</p>
<hint>
  A date picker is also helpful when the formatting of the date is important.
