<h1>Stepper</h1>
<p>An input stepper is a two-segment UI control used to incrementally increase or decrease a numeric value.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Steppers work well for fields that have one commonly entered value and most other input values deviate only slightly from that. If there is a lot of variability in the range of values that users normally enter for a field (e.g., for age or date of birth), a stepper is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Set the most frequently selected value as a stepper default.</p>
<p>Avoid steppers for continuous quantities. By design, stepper fields can only take discrete values â€” that is, multiples of the step increment. (You cannot specify 1.5 items for a quantity stepper.) Sometimes, it makes sense to transform continuous variables into discrete ones (for example, we usually treat age as a discrete variable, counted in years).</p>

<h3>When to use</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The numeric field has a most commonly selected value and most users will not deviate insignificantly from it (e.g.e.g., dose amount).
  </li>
  <li>
    The numeric field needs to be adjusted by a small, discrete amount or precision is not important (e.g., number of bedrooms).	
  </li>
  <li>
    There is enough room for generous spacing of the stepper segments.	
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When not to use</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The numeric field can take a wide range of values (e.g., age), with no one value being entered significantly more often than others.
  </li>
  <li>
    The numeric field is continuous and the exact value is important.
  </li>
  <li>
    Limited design space for button layout would make the stepper segments small or cramped.
  </li>
</ul>



<hint class="warning"> In many situations, transforming a continuous variable (such as prices or distances) into a discrete one with the wrong step can be irritating or inappropriate for the user task.</hint>



<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>

<p>A stepper contains the following elements:</p>

<h6>Minus Button</h6>
Decrease the value.
<hr>
<h6>Value</h6>
Current selected value
<hr>
<h6>Plus Button</h6>
Increase the value.
<hr>
<h6>Units (Optional)</h6>
Always on the right to define the units of the value.

<hint>You should make the step and the unit explicit  (e.g., days, cents, percentage). Also, if the input value has a maximum or minimum limit, be sure to indicate it. It is usually best to have a stepper change the current value by a step of one unit per button-press, but there can be cases where other step values are more appropriate, if indicated by a task analysis.</hint>
