<h1>Slider</h1>
<p>A slider is a control element that uses a knob or lever moved horizontally to control a variable.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<p>Sliders allow users to view and select a value (or range) from the range along a bar.
    They’re ideal for adjusting settings such as volume and brightness, or for applying image filters.</p>

<p>Sliders can use icons on both ends of the bar to represent a numeric or relative scale.
    The range of values or the nature of the values, such as volume change, can be communicated with icons.</p>

<hint>Use a slider only when the precise value won’t matter to the user, but rather only the approximate range. Make sure that the users can select that range correctly without having to struggle too much to hit a precise value.</hint>

<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>

<p>A slider can contain the following elements:</p>
<h3>Track</h3>
<p>The track shows the range that is available for a user to select from.
    For left-to-right (LTR) languages, the smallest value appears on the far left end of the track and the
    largest value is on the far right. For right-to-left (RTL) languages this orientation is reversed.</p>

<h3>Thumb</h3>
<p>The thumb is a position indicator that can be moved along the track,
    displaying the selected value of its position.</p>

<h3>Value label (optional)</h3>
<p>A value label displays the specific numeric value that corresponds with the thumb’s placement.</p>

<h3>Tick mark (optional)</h3>
<p>Tick marks along a track represent predetermined values that the user can move the slider to.</p>
