<h1>Toggle selector</h1>
<p>
    Toggle selector allow users to toggle between two or more content sections within the same space on screen.
</p>


<div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">

</div>


<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
    Allow users to toggle between alternate views of similar or related content. Only one content section is shown at a time.
    </p>

    <h3>When to use</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Toggle selectoron are frequently used to let users toggle between different formatting, like with a grid view and a table view.</li>
    <li>They are also often used to narrow content groups. For example, use a content switcher if you have a single category, such as "E-mail" and you want to divide it into views such as "All", "Read", and "Unread".</li>
</ul>

<h3>When not to use</h3>
<b>Tabs</b>
<p>
    Use tabs when the content on the page is divided into related sections, but without any overlap. Tabs follow the metaphor for sections in a filing cabinet and two tabs wouldn’t contain the same sheet of paper. So the role of tabs in information hierarchy is to separate content.
</p>

<b>Toggle</b>
<p>
The toggle selector is used for large groups of content, as opposed to the switch which is meant for a “yes/no” or “on/off” binary decision.
</p>


<h2 id="sizing">Sizing</h2>
<h3>Height</h3>
<p>
    There are three height sizes for the content switcher: small (32px), medium (38px), and large (44px). Choose a size that best fits the density of your layout or the prominence of the switcher.
