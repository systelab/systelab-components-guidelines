<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>


<h3>When to use</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Select a single option from a list</li>
    <li>Expose all available options</li>
</ul>
<p>If available options can be collapsed, consider using a dropdown menu instead, as it uses less space.</p>

<p>Always offer a default selection for radio button lists. By definition, radio buttons always have exactly one option selected, and you therefore shouldn't display them without a default selection.</p>

<hint>Visually present groups of choices as groups, and clearly separate them from other groups on the same page.</hint>



<h3>When not to use</h3>
<p>
    If a user can select many options from a list, use checkboxes instead of radio buttons. Radio buttons allow the user to select only one item in a set whereas checkboxes allow the user to select multiple options.
</p>
<hint>
    Don't use radio buttons when multiple items can be selected.

</div>

<p>
    If you must use a horizontal layout with multiple options per line, make sure to space the buttons and labels so that it's abundantly clear which choice goes with which label.

<hint>
    Avoid multiline labels in inline layout
</hint>





<h2 id="options">Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Because radio buttons require exactly one choice, make sure that the options are both comprehensive and clearly distinct.</li>
    <li>Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels, so that it's clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox. In other words, avoid negations such as "Don't send me more email," which would mean that the user would have to check the box in order for something not to happen.</li>
    <li>If users might need to refrain from making a selection, you should provide a radio button for this choice, such as one labeled "None." Offering users an explicit, neutral option to click is better than requiring the implicit act of not selecting from the list, especially because doing the latter violates the rule of always having exactly one option chosen.</li>
</ul>
