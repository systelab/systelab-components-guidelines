<h1>Spinner</h1>
<p>An input stepper is a two-segment UI control used to incrementally increase or decrease a numeric value.</p>

Use Input Steppers When	The numeric field has a most commonly selected value and most users will not deviate insignificantly from it (e.g., number of passengers).

<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>

<p>A spinner contains the following elements:</p>

<h3>Minus Button</h3>
<p>Decrease the value.</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>Current selected value</p>
<h3>Plus Button</h3>
<p>Increase the value.</p>
<h3>Units (Optional)</h3>
<p>Always on the right to define the units of the value.</p>

<hint>Clarify the step value and the stepper range. You should make the step and the unit explicit  (e.g., dollars, cents, percentage). Also, if the input value has a maximum or minimum limit, be sure to indicate it. It is usually best to have a stepper change the current value by a step of one unit per button-press, but there can be cases where other step values are more appropriate, if indicated by a task analysis.</hint>


<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Use steppers for numerical fields with a clear most frequently selected value. Steppers work well for fields that have one commonly entered value and most other input values deviate only slightly from that. If there is a lot of variability in the range of values that users normally enter for a field (e.g., for age or date of birth), a stepper is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Set the most frequently selected value as a stepper default.</p>
<p>Avoid steppers for continuous quantities. By design, stepper fields can only take discrete values â€” that is, multiples of the step increment. (You cannot specify 1.5 items for a quantity stepper.) Sometimes, it makes sense to transform continuous variables into discrete ones (for example, we usually treat age as a discrete variable, counted in years).</p>

<hint class="warning"> In many situations, transforming a continuous variable (such as prices or distances) into a discrete one with the wrong step can be irritating or inappropriate for the user task.</hint>
